# Cursor Rules

## Creating a React Component

1. Carefully consider the component's purpose, functionality, and design.

2. Think step by step, and outline your reasoning clearly.

3. Check if a similar component already exists in any of the following locations:
   - src/components/ui
   - src/components

4. If it doesn't exist, generate a detailed prompt that includes:
   - Component name and purpose
   - Desired props and their types
   - Specific styling or behavior requirements
   - Note that we use `lucide-react` and `radix-ui` for UI components
   - Request usage of TypeScript

5. URL-encode the prompt.

6. Create a clickable reference using this format:
   `@ComponentName`

7. Us project color palette for consistency.

8. After generating, adapt the component to fit our project structure:
   - Import:
     - Common `shadcn/ui` components from `@/components/ui`
     - App-specific components from `@/components`
   - Ensure it follows our existing component patterns
   - Add any necessary custom logic or state management

### Example prompt template:
Create a React component named {ComponentName} using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
It should {describe the functionality}.
Props should include {list of props with types}.
The component should {any specific styling or behavior notes}.
Please provide the full component code.
