## You are developing an application in react with radix-ui and lucide-react libraries, use zod for all validation. 

- Use react-query to comminicate with api. If an api is not yet created, create the react-query impementations using the mockdata.
- The application should have multiple language support. Make sure you add these when implementing new code.
