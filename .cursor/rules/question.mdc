## Using the -q Flag for Question-Driven Solutions

Use the `-q` flag in your prompt when you want a comprehensive, question-led response.

What the -q flag does:
When -q is used, the AI will respond with:
- A thorough problem analysis
- Clarifying questions about ambiguous requirements
- Alternative approaches with pros and cons
- Edge case considerations
- Suggested testing strategies

Example -q prompts:
-q How should we implement user authentication in our app?
-q What ’s the best way to handle real-time updates in our relay system?
-q How can we optimize the performance of our map rendering?

Expected response structure:
Do not change any code
1. Problem Analysis
   - Current situation
   - Requirements
   - Constraints

2. Clarifying Questions
   - What is the expected user load?
   - Do we need multiple authentication methods?
   - What are the security requirements?

3. Proposed Solution
   - Step-by-step plan
   - Code examples
   - Best practices

4. Considerations
   - Performance
   - Security
   - Scalability

5. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Performance tests

## Iterative Problem Solving with AI

Use this process for solving complex problems or implementing multi-step features.

1. Start with a clear problem statement:
   - What’s the goal?
   - What are the constraints?
   - What outcome do we expect?

2. Break down the solution into steps:
   - Ask the AI to outline the plan
   - Confirm each step before continuing

3. For each step:
   - Request detailed explanations and code samples
   - Ask questions when something is unclear

4. Review your implementation:
   - Ask the AI for feedback
   - Example: "Can you review this implementation and suggest improvements?"

5. Test and validate:
   - Ask for relevant test cases
   - Get debugging support

6. Document:
   - Ask for inline code comments
   - Get help writing concise documentation

Example conversation:
User: I need to implement a feature that allows users to filter a list of items. Can you break down the approach?
AI: [Provides step-by-step breakdown]
User: Can you explain step 1 in more detail?
AI: [Provides detailed explanation]
User: Here's my implementation. Can you review it?
AI: [Reviews and suggests improvements]
User: What test cases should we consider?
AI: [Provides test cases]
User: How should we document this?
AI: [Provides documentation suggestions]

Tips:
- Be specific with your prompts
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Request examples to understand better
- Confirm before moving on
- Document along the way
